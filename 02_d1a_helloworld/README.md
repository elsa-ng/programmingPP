# Chapter 2 - Drill #1

## Purpose
The purpose of a drill is to establish or reinfore practical programming skills learned from the chapter and to provide experience with programming environment tools. A drill is a sequence of modifications to a single program, growing it from something completely trivia to something that might be a useful part of a real program.

## Objective
* Familiarize with [Microsofot Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
  * Create an Empty Project
  * Create a .h file
  * Create a .cpp file
* Use C++ standard and custom libraries
* Output a string to console
* Debug the code

## Instructions
1. Set up an Empty Project in [Microsofot Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
2. Create a .cpp file and name it `hello_world.cpp`
3. In the .cpp file, input one of the following code:
```C++
#include "std_lib_facilities.h"
int main() {
  cout << "Hello, World!\n";
  keep_window_open();
  return 0;
}
```
4. Try using a standard C++ library instead of the custom library and modify the code to use the standard library
5. Fix errors, if any
6. Create errors and see how the compiler reacts
