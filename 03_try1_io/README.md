# Chapter 3 - Try This #1

## Purpose
**Try this** is generally in the nature of a drill focused narrowly on the topic that precedes it. **Try this** either complements the  chapter drill or is a part of it. Those who like to put the book aside and try some examples before reading to the end of a chapter will find **Try this** beneficial to their learning.

## Objective
* Familiarize with user input
* Store input values into different object types
* Naming variables
* Initialize variables
* Assign values to variables
* Operate on variables
* Work with type safety


## Instructions for Try This #1
1. Get the "name and age" example to run.
2. Modify it to write out the age in months:
    * Read the input in years and multiply by 12
3. Read the age into a double to allow for children who can be very proud of being five and a half years old rather than just five

## Instruction for Try This #2
1. In the same `main()` function that was used for Try This #1, prompt user to enter a floating-point number
2. Read the input and store it into a variable of type `double`
3. Output the results of different operations done to the variable:
   * addition
   * subtraction
   * multiplication
   * division
   * square
   * square root
4. Prompt the user for an Integer this time
5. Read the input and store it into a variable of type `int`
6. Output the results of the same operations and note the differences  

#### Side Note: 
Square root function is not defined for variable of type `int`, so do remainder/modulous instead.
